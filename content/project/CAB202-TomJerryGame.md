# Overview
Tom and Jerry Game was an assessment from the unit CAB202: Microcontrollers and Digital Systems in Semester 2 of 2019 at Queensland University of Technology. The task was bringing to life the classic characters of Tom and Jerry in a terminal based game. Tom is a cat with the simple agenda of catching the mouse, Jerry, running rampant in his house. Tom runs around the room Jerry is in, dropping mousetraps periodically, and constantly changing his direction to move toward Jerry. Jerry just wants cheese, and is faster than Tom, but after he has consumed enough cheese, and taken the chase to the second room of the day, he likes to have a bit of fun by introducing some weapons of his own to direct at Tom.

# Design
The language the class taught was C, so naturally the language of this project was C with only the standard library and provided QUT libraries. This assessment used an internal terminal display library (made by QUT) and gcc (c99).

# Result
The final result I got was 22.50/30. I lost majority of the marks by failing to implement diagonal collisions.

It is uploaded as is on [GitHub](https://github.com/audibailey/cab202-tomjerrygame) 
with no alterations other than some information on how to make it run with the
provided examples.
