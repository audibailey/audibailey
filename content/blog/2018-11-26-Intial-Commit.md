# Welcome

I guess this is now my permanant place of operations. So welcome, check out
projects or my about me page or my contact me and hopefully something interests
you in there. Anyways time to get to the nitty gritty on why this site exists.

# Why?

Well I noticed that a lot of professional developers have their own website that
shows of their wonderful portfolio of content and some developers have blogs. So
the point of this site is to do both of them. Have a central place to present my
content to an audience and show of my portofilio in a way that has my own
individual touch. As an added benefit this place might help me with writing. In
general my writing skills are pretty poor, as you can probably tell after
reading to this point and maybe reading my about me page. I'm hoping this
website will help me with that.

# Whats next?
So I don't actually know what I want to do with this website per se. But
recently I've moved homes and was inspired by [Nikita
Voloboev](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz) to start working on my way of life. In
particularly journalling and a knowledge wiki because I feel like I have a lot
of stuff that I need to write down and clear my brain. I'm also interested in my
development workflow and online presence. At the moment my development workflow
is pretty much what comes I do, nothing concise or adaptable; just a lot of
duct tape holding the fort together. My online presence is also largely a mess,
mainly because I've been using the internet for a long time and as a result I've
gone through many, many, many aliases. 

# Closing thoughts
So yeah, I hope this gives me some incentive to start working on those parts of
 life. I'll also attempt to document a lot of it as I go and attempt to 
 semi-regularly upload blog posts about it. Oh yeah and don't forget to check my
 links out on the left and feel free to contact me. Until next time, ja ne.
