	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>
		So hi, my name is Perdana Audi Bailey. I am a university student studying a dual degree in electrical engineering and computer science at Queensland University of Technology. Which means I'm based in the great city of Brisbane.

		I started writing software all the way back in 2011 (when I was like 12), I wouldn't really consider it as writing software but more so hacking existing code to work (unsuccessfully usually).

		I enjoy watching TV shows, anime and movies while I am home. I enjoy going out to the city for the night and hanging out with friends.

	<h2>My Journey (so far)</h2>
	<p>
		I guess my journey is just beginning but as stated before I started programming in 2011, I would hack Habbo Retro CMS's and Emulators to try and get them to work. I've always had an interested in computers since a very young age, mainly playing browser games like Adventure Quest and breaking computers from testing random things (woops).
		During highschool I refined my skill by, yep gaming, I used to play minecraft modpacks and used lua with the mod computercraft. This was, I think my first real chance at programming something, albeit it was in a game I think it still counts.
		From there I learnt HTML, CSS and JS just for the sake of knowing it which inadvertadly got me into Linux. I was sick of trying to put my websites through cPanel so I learnt about VPS's and Linux.
		After that my knowledge increased exponentially as I quit gaming and got accepted into an early entry university course where I learnt Python and became a freelance contractor for HTPCGuides. I made the MyBB plugin and the multimonit project for the site, along with multiple media guides specialising in Arch linux.
		That stepped up my knowledge in CS by multiple steps, I graduated highschool (in 2016) and worked in junior system administration for a year with a particular interest in DevOps. From that I got a Certificate III in Information Technology and Digital Media.
		Since 2018 I've been at Queensland University of Technology studying a Bachelor of Engineering and Information Technology, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In 2019, I became a Peer Leader for IFB105 (database management) at the university and am now looking at trying to become a teacher at the univeristy.
